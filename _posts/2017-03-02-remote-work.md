About a year ago, I started working 100% remote. It has been a very rewarding journey. So naturally, I feel it is a good time to look back and share my feelings.

### Working from home ###

I recently moved to Margaret River, Western Australia. It is a beautiful area and I feel really close to nature. I can go for a surf or a hike before work. Being part of the community is very rewarding, as working from home somehow limit your social interactions.

I have a dedicated office in my house. It allows me to make a clear distinction between my family/free time and work.

I don't believe a lot of things are required, but there are a few essentials:
- a good microphone for better communication ( preferably unidirectional )
- a laptop stand and a good chair for a healthy posture
- a fast, stable internet connection

### Digital nomad lifestyle ###

I also spent two months working from Indonesia. It is only a 3 hours flight and being immersed in a different culture is really refreshing.

The best tip I can give you is to go to a co-working space. They have fast internet and you don't have to think about having a desk when renting a place. They also provide the opportunities to meet fellow remote workers and host events.

The co-working space I stayed at was [dojo bali](http://www.dojobali.org/en).

### Transition ###

It takes some time to adjust, mostly the communication side of things. Using great tools helps a lot ( e.g. for pairing I use [screenhero](https://screenhero.com/) )

You may have to ask your employer or clients to adapt their workflow. I work for a company which has a lot of remote staffs, so that was not an issue.

But overall it is amazing! My only advice, if you consider going remote, is *just do it*. It is probably much easier than you think.
