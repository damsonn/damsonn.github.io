I have been thinking about starting a blog for a little while now.
I heard about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) a couple of years ago, it seemed like a good fit so I tried it.
It is a very simple static site generator, which process markdown files.

### Octopress

Then I started looking at [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), mainly because of the collection of themes.
It provides some features on top of *Jekyll*, such as a plugin mechanism, deployment options...
Overall I don't really need anything from it and I actually preferred the simplicity of Jekyll. Without going in the details, I felt it is a bit too complicated for what it does.
The main dev of Octopress is currently working on [Octopress 3](http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/).
It should create a much more modular foundation and hopefully become cleaner ecosystem.

### Back to Jekyll
So I started looking for a nice *Jekyll* theme and found [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper). It is a great minimal theme (based on the ghost default theme).
It is responsive and very easy to hack. What I learnt from all that search is that it is always better to start simple and build upon it!

### Github pages

Something to note is that [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses *Jekyll*, so you have a free hosting option.
On top of being free you have you end up with site hosted from your *GIT* repo, which is a neat feature for a developer.
