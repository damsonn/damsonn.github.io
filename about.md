title: About me
---

My name is Damien Dormal and I am a software developer based in Margaret river, Western Australia. The languages I master are Javascript (and node.js), Ruby, Java, but I like to explore and I am comfortable with Python, Scala and C.

I worked in many different industries, such as telecom, eduction and public sector. More recently, I am trying to get a bit more involved with the open source community through helping projects on [github](https://github.com/).
